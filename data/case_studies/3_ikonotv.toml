Body = """IkonoTV is a Berlin based art video company which broadcasts a 24 / 7 stream and provides a large and diverse catalog of on demand content. After six months as a Twivel customer IkonoTV engaged me as an interim CTO to help them with a range of technology opportunites and problems.

As part of my work with them I helped migrate the organisation on to Google Apps, assess the SmartTV technology landscape and create a 24 month technology and roadmap.

IkonoTV sponsored the development of a React based web app and payment and subcriptions for Twivel.
