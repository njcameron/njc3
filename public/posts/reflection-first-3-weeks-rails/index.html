            One of my goals for 2016 is to use more non-drupal stuff and expand my tech horizons. This is how the first three weeks have played out.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>I first became aware of RoR back in 2006 around the same time I read the brilliant <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> from the company previously known as 37 Signals (now Basecamp). At that point I was busy wrapping my head around Drupal 4.7 and building out a social network for language learners known as Huitalk. Since then I have followed its adoption with interest but always been too professionally involved with Drupal to do more than tinker around the edges.</p>

<p>Before I knuckled down to build the <a href="https://twivel.tv">Twivel</a> MVP, my initial choice was to build it with Drupal 8. It was an obvious choice because Twivel is essentially a content management system with an API and it would be a great opportunity to really get to grips with Drupal 8. However, over the holidays the idea of learning something totally different came into my mind. Why? Well, I think there is a FOMO very specific to developers which is fuelled by the framework wars. No matter how much cool stuff you made with framework X, there is always framework Y which is apparently better at A, B and C.</p>

<p>So on Jan 4th, my first day of &ldquo;MVP development&rdquo;, I was up to my eyeballs in blog posts and hello world tutorials comparing Python / Django to Ruby / Rails to PHP / Symfony to PHP / Laravel to node.js / Express. In the end I went with RoR based on the track record of usage and huge body of tutorials and Stack Overflow posts that have proved invaluable with Drupal development.</p>

<p>I started off by doing a few walk throughs. I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="http://www.devwalks.com/">Ben Walker&rsquo;s tutorials</a> and within a couple of days I had my Instagram knock-off up and running and felt reasonably confident I would be able to hack something together for Twivel.</p>

<p>The first week of dev was painful. No two ways about it. Every fibre in my body screamed at me to go back to what I knew. Achieving even the simplest task took hours. There was a constant stream of surprises including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Needing to add a field to a form template before I can use it.</li>
<li>Spending a day to add categories with, gasp, an autocomplete form.</li>
<li>Spending half a day to add minimum dimension validation to an image upload field.</li>
<li>Needing to manually specify system messages for when content was successfully created, updated or destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you known anything about Drupal you will know everything above &ldquo;just happens&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Once I got more comfortable with the development paradigm of RoR I started to have small, very small, moments of clarity and joy. I was beginning to see what all the fuss was about. Fast forward three weeks to today and I am happily using Rspec for TDD, I have built out most of the functionality and even got a RESTful API up and running.</p>

<p>What surprised me most, was how useful my Drupal development experience was in making the switch. There are many RoR concepts which are analogous in Drupal, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrations ≈ features</li>
<li>rake / rails ≈ drush</li>
<li>gems ≈ modules</li>
<li>views ≈ theme templates</li>
<li>controllers ≈ modules</li>
<li>associations ≈ entity references</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there are the specific RoR things which I have really been enjoying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tight integration of code, test framework (Rspec / FactoryGirl) and server make writing tests and TDD feel like a really natural part of the development process. With Drupal, Selenium tests always felt like a post development bolt-on and I never quite got comfortable with making Behat tests part of the development process.</li>
<li>Keeping route config in code gives you complete certainty over your applications capabilities. No more randomly discovering derivative paths that a module created for you.</li>
<li>Keeping all config in migrations (code) effortlessly does what Features and CMI set out to achieve.</li>
<li>The rails asset pipeline makes working with SASS effortless.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I going to ditch Drupal and go with Rails from now on? No chance. I think Drupal is a brilliant solution when an application is mostly content management or when you are time constrained to build something that looks good and delivers CMS functionality.</p>

<p>But all in all I am really happy with my choice of using RoR for Twivel. The biggest advantage I see right now is a lean codebase with nothing unnecessary and no surprises. I am really looking forward to seeing how RoR works out as things get more complex with multi-tenancy, caching and eventually payments.</p>
