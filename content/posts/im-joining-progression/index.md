## The Search
When we [left our hero](/posts/writing-my-next-steps/) in July 2018 I concluded with *"Iâ€™m back in the consulting game while I search for the Next Big Thing".* That mostly worked out, although I quickly found myself back at the [Wellcome Trust](https://medium.com/wellcome-digital) and due a winning combination of interesting work, great colleagues and an outrageously good office canteen, I ended up staying there until the end of March 2019.

I was lucky enough to be mostly working 3 days a week, which gave me some time for tinkering and looking for what to do next.

I've been a fan of [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) for a while and around this time the [Indie London](https://indieldn.com/events/) community started a series of meetups. The meetups are an excellent way to get inspiration and meet people working on their own bootstrapped tech businesses.

One way they facilitate the community is through Slack, and one of the channels is "trades", a place where you can post what you're looking for and what you're offering. I thought I'd take a punt and see if there was anyone out there that wanted to work together. Then this happened:
