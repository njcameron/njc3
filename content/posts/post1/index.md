**The Origin**

Twivel was born out of three converging occurrences: 1) a frustration with crap television but great internet video, 2) the release of the 4th gen Apple TV, 3) an itch to learn a new framework.

At some point in 2015 we bought a new TV with built in Android and Wi-Fi. This was the first time I had a TV in the living room since leaving home at 18. I quickly realised there was a gulf between mainstream TV -- think “Bake Off” -- and the kind of video I had been used to watching: tech video podcasts, LSE lectures and judo competitions. If only there was a simple way of consuming this kind of niche video content on my beautiful 43” screen without fiddling around with HDMI cables or hunting around a YouTube app....

Towards the end of 2015 Apple launched the 4th gen Apple TV. What made this one different from previous generations was a new platform, tvOS and the Apple TV app store. This would mean that organisations could easily build and release their own apps for TV. After a bit of digging I found out about TVML, a set of standard templates and elements that Apple offered to easily create tvOS apps. Having spent years building backend content management systems for apps and the web, I was interested to see if I could build a web-based platform which could be used to drive these templates and create apps.
