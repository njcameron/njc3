**Summary**: Iâ€™m a full stack, tech / product / business guy that gets a kick out of building brilliant products and teams. I previously founded Twivel, a video-on-demand startup, and Cameron & Wilding a leading web dev agency working with publishers.

**About me**: I work across the full spectrum of building tech products from customer engagement, defining features and user stories, through to system architecture, development, overseeing testing and final deployment. I really enjoy the human aspect too; hiring, mentoring and performance management. What really gives me a kick is building a high performing team that cares about quality and shipping a product that delights customers. I get my hands dirty with a range of technologies including Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, ReactJS, Drupal, PHP, AWS and iOS / tvOS.

**Previously**: I spent 2016 building on Twivel a white label, video-on-demand platform that enables video publishers to create their own "mini-iPlayer" app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, with no development. Twivel now supports hundreds of thousands of users for The Economist and Ikono TV.

In 2010 I co-founded and worked with Ben to build up Cameron & Wilding to become a twelve person software development company. In early 2015 I handed things over to my business partner and set out to find new challenges. Before C&W I worked as a freelance developer, co-founded a social network for language learners and worked as a consultant for Accenture. My perpetual curiosity is reflected in my academic background: BA in Thai Language and Religious Studies, MA in Economics of Latin America. I speak Thai and Spanish and have spent chunks of time living in Thailand, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires and of course London.

**Work with me**:  I'm currently looking for my Next Big Thing to commit to, I'm itching to work with a post-product market fit startup where I can take on a key leadership role, build a team and ship great product.

To get in touch ping me an email or connect on LinkedIn. Although I'm based in London, I'm open to working world-wide. My CV is available to download here.
