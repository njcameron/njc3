**Summary**: I work at the intersection of technology, product and delivery to help organisations ship brilliant products. When not helping clients I build my own products like Twivel, a video-on-demand platform. I've been building products for the web for 15 years, during which time I've been CTO at an early stage startup, founded my own SaaS company and co-founded and ran a thriving digital agency.

I enjoy getting my hands dirty with a range of technologies including ruby on rails, javascript (node & react), drupal, PHP, AWS, JIRA and espresso machines.

**Previously**: Most recently I worked with [EmpowerRD](https://empowerrd.com), a London based fintech startup, to design and build their core product. Prior to that I spent most of 2016-17 on [Twivel](http://twivel.tv) a white label, video-on-demand platform that enables video publishers to create their own "mini-iPlayer" app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, with no development. Twivel now supports hundreds of thousands of users for [The Economist](https://films.economist.com/) and Ikono TV.

In 2010 I co-founded [Cameron & Wilding](http://cameronandwilding.com) with Ben and built it up to become a twelve person digital agency and one the UK's leading Drupal companies. We worked with organisations like The BBC, Daily Telegraph and The Economist to help them build world class, digital products. Before C&W I worked as a freelance developer, co-founded a social network for language learners and worked as a consultant for Accenture. 

My innate curiosity is reflected in my academic background: BA in Thai language and the study of religion ([SOAS](https://www.soas.ac.uk/sea/)), MA in Economics of Latin America ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/americas)). I speak Thai and Spanish and have spent chunks of time living in Thailand, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires and, of course, London.

**Work with me**: I typically work on short-term consulting engagements to help organisations release a key product, plan out a roadmap or research and solve a strategic technology issue.
